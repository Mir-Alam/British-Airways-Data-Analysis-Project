## Project Goals
To analyze customer ratings and feedback to identify areas of improvement.
To provide actionable insights to British Airways for improving service offerings, especially focusing on aircraft types, routes, and seat comfort.
## Data
The dataset consists of reviews from customers who have flown with British Airways, with details on their experiences related to:

Aircraft type
Routes flown
Ratings for various service aspects (e.g., seat comfort, overall experience, etc.)
Monthly travel trends
Analysis and Visualizations
Average Rating by Aircraft Type: We analyzed how different aircraft types were rated by passengers, providing insights into which aircraft require more attention for improvements.


Routes Offering Good Value for Money: By examining reviews, we identified routes that passengers felt offered good value for money, helping British Airways focus on improving or maintaining these routes.


Aircraft Routes: An in-depth analysis of aircraft routes, including average ratings for each route, to determine areas that may require more attention in terms of service.


Travelled by Month: A look at monthly travel patterns to better understand seasonal trends and customer behaviors. This can help in resource and staff planning.


Seat Comfort Rating: Seat comfort was a key factor in overall satisfaction, and this analysis focused on how passengers rated the comfort of their seats.
